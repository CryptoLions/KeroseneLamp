# KeroseneLamp

The KeroseneLamp uses the Simple Assets standard for digital assets (https://github.com/cryptolions/simpleassets) to create a lantern which can be used for promotions.

The contract allows for the creation of one (and only one at this point) NFT lantern, and for the creation of fungible tokens FUEL and SPARK.

Users who keep the latern burning while passing it to new users are tracked in a table, and can be awared with prizes.
